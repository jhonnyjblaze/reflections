What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You move into the directory you want to create a repository for and run the command git init.
Git responded "Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/jblaze/Desktop/udacity_Shell/version-control/reflections/.git/"
From here now I can create git commits and begin to take advantage of the power of version-control.
Beyond version-control, I now have a repository that can be cloned by other Git users.
Now multiple parties can contribute to the repository in a decentralized manner.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediary between the repository and the working directory.
The reposiotry recieves files from the working directory by passing files to it via the staging area.
The command git add [filename] adds a file to the staging area.
The command git status will display the files currently in the staging area and the remaining files in the working directory.
This gives you the opportunity to reconsider the files you have placed in the staging area before you create a new Git commit.
The repository is the location on Git of a clone of your local workding directory including only the files included in your Git commits.
